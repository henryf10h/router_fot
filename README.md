# STARKNET WINTER HACKATHON PROJECT

## FoT router for JEDISWAP V1
Proudly introducing the FoT Router for JEDISWAP V1, the first router in the StarkNet ecosystem to handle fee-on-transfer (FoT) tokens, unveiled at the StarkNet Winter Hackathon. This innovation sets a new standard for token swaps, enhancing StarkNet's DeFi landscape.

Efforts to extend this functionality to JEDISWAP V2 are ongoing, though challenges remain. We're dedicated to achieving this milestone.

FoT tokens, or reflective/deflationary tokens, incorporate transaction fees that benefit holders or reduce supply, promising a dynamic token economy. Our router facilitates these tokens' integration, broadening trading possibilities on JEDISWAP.
